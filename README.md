Hello and welcome to my portfolio.
This portfolio should show my skill in web-development.
Firstly, I had a lot of fun :)

Enough with bullshit talking.

Let's start.
Which development and management tools did I use?
For the frontend-build I used npm. With npm I downloaded Bower and Gulp.
But why Gulp and Bower? Or a better question, what are those tools?
Bower is not more than a plugin for downloading and integrating some packages (bootstrap, lightbox etc.) into the project.
With gulp i wrote some tasks. Tasks such as: convert *.scss to *.css files. The main reason why I used Gulp, is because today it's one of the most important plugins/tools in the web development and I wanna know more about it.
For this project I just wrote simple tiny tasks, in that case don't expect big tasks like see in the web.

That was enough theory. Do business.
Before you  start and wanna have a look into my Portfolio, download npm.
If you have it, navigate with the terminal/cmd to "Garavaldi_Website".
Now type in -> npm run gulp.
Wait until "Finished 'default' after ..." appears.
If it's the case, start and watch my portfolio. I hope you will enjoy.

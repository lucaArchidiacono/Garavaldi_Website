**Welcome to the Portfolio from Luca Archidiacono.**

Before you start with anything. Do you have node.js?
If you don't have it, download: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Then download my Github workspace.
After you finished downloading, open the cmd/terminal.

Now navigate till you reach my portfolio workspace.
Then there you type-in: `$ npm install --save-dev.`
The cmd/terminal should start downloading every node_modules file.
After downloading everything, type-in: `$ npm run gulp`

_If you have an error try once again, but this time in su root mode._

At the end, when everything is fine and downloaded, you should see now my page on your webscreen.

If you don't wanna use node.js/gulp you can also run a local tomact server.
Just create a new Server and let run it over the project Garavaldi_Website.

And if you wanna run it without a local-Webserver. Please use firefox, safari and co. But not Google Chrome.
I don't know why, but Google Chrome doesn't allow to run javascript locally.

Have fun :)

**Welcome to the Portfolio from Luca Archidiacono.**

Before you start with anything. Just download my Github workspace.
After you finished downloading, open the cmd/terminal up.

Now navigate till you reach my portfolio workspace.
Then there you type-in: `$ npm run gulp.`
Now the cmd/terminal should start doing something.

If you have an error try once again, but this time in su root mode.

At the end, when everything is fine, you should now see my page on your webscreen.

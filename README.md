**Welcome to the Portfolio from Luca Archidiacono.**

Before you start with anything. Do you have node.js?
If you don't have it, download: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Then download my Github workspace.
After you finished downloading, open the cmd/terminal.

Now navigate till you reach my portfolio workspace.
Then there you type-in: `$ npm install --save-dev.`
The cmd/terminal should start downloading every node_modules file.
After downloading everything, type-in: `$ npm run gulp`

_If you have an error try once again, but this time in su root mode._

At the end, when everything is fine and downloaded, you should see now my page on your webscreen.

Have fun :)
